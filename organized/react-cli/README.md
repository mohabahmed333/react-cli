### Naming Conventions

- **Directories**: Use lowercase and separate words with hyphens (e.g., `ai`, `utils`, `commands`).
- **Files**: Use camelCase for file names (e.g., `codeGeneration.ts`, `logger.ts`).
- **Constants**: Use uppercase with underscores for constants (e.g., `AI_FEATURES_ENABLED`).
- **Functions/Classes**: Use camelCase for function and class names (e.g., `generateCode`, `DocumentationGenerator`).

### Roadmap for New Contributors

1. **Getting Started**
   - Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
   - Install dependencies: `npm install`
   - Familiarize yourself with the project structure.

2. **Understanding the Codebase**
   - Review the `README.md` for an overview of the project.
   - Explore the `src` directory to understand how features are organized.
   - Check the `config` directory for configuration settings.

3. **Contributing to Features**
   - Identify a feature you want to work on (e.g., AI features, CLI commands).
   - Create a new branch for your feature: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
   - Implement your changes following the established naming conventions.
   - Write tests for your feature if applicable.

4. **Testing Your Changes**
   - Run existing tests to ensure nothing is broken: `npm test`
   - Add new tests for your feature if necessary.

5. **Submitting Your Changes**
   - Commit your changes with a clear message: `git commit -m "Add feature: description"`
   - Push your branch: `git push origin feature/your-feature-name`
   - Create a pull request and describe your changes.

6. **Review Process**
   - Be open to feedback from maintainers.
   - Make necessary adjustments based on review comments.

7. **Staying Updated**
   - Regularly pull changes from the main branch to keep your branch up to date.
   - Engage with the community through issues and discussions.

By following this structured approach, new contributors will have a clearer understanding of how to navigate the project and contribute effectively.
