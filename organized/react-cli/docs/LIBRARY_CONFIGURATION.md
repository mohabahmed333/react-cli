### Naming Conventions

- **Directories**: Use lowercase and separate words with hyphens (e.g., `user-management`, `ai`).
- **Files**: Use camelCase for file names (e.g., `codeGeneration.ts`, `apiService.ts`).
- **Components**: Use PascalCase for React components (e.g., `Button.tsx`, `Modal.tsx`).

### Roadmap for New Contributors

1. **Getting Started**
   - Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
   - Install dependencies: `npm install`
   - Run the project locally: `npm start`

2. **Understanding the Structure**
   - Familiarize yourself with the project structure outlined above.
   - Review the `README.md` file for additional context and guidelines.

3. **Working on Features**
   - Identify a feature or bug to work on.
   - Create a new branch for your work: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
   - Implement your changes in the appropriate directory (e.g., `features/ai` for AI-related features).

4. **Testing Your Changes**
   - Write unit tests for your new feature or changes.
   - Run tests to ensure everything works as expected: `npm test`

5. **Documentation**
   - Update the documentation in `docs/` if necessary.
   - Ensure that any new features are documented in the `LIBRARY_CONFIGURATION.md` file.

6. **Submitting Your Changes**
   - Commit your changes: `git commit -m "Add your commit message"`
   - Push your branch: `git push origin feature/your-feature-name`
   - Create a pull request (PR) against the main branch.

7. **Code Review**
   - Participate in the code review process.
   - Address any feedback provided by maintainers.

8. **Continuous Learning**
   - Stay updated with project discussions and decisions.
   - Engage with the community for support and collaboration.

By following this structured approach, new contributors will have a clearer understanding of the project and how to contribute effectively.
